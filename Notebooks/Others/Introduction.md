## **Introduction**

Self-consumption energy systems (*Unidades de Produção para Autoconsumo* – UPACs) have become an essential part of Portugal’s ongoing energy transition, mirroring the European commitment to decentralized and renewable generation. Encouraged by supportive regulation and declining photovoltaic costs, these systems allow consumers to produce, store, and use electricity locally. In doing so, they reduce dependence on the national grid and contribute to the achievement of national decarbonization objectives. Their rapid expansion in recent years demonstrates their strategic role across both residential and industrial sectors.

However, this growth has not been uniform across the country. The installed capacity of UPACs varies considerably between districts, voltage levels, and installation sizes. Residential units, generally linked to low-voltage networks, are widespread but small in capacity, while industrial systems, connected at medium or high voltage, are fewer in number but represent a substantial share of total installed power. These differences reflect variations in regional economic activity, the availability of space, and the rate of technology adoption, highlighting the need for region-specific, data-driven analyses to inform energy policy and planning.

The present study is based on a comprehensive dataset provided by e-Redes, which includes all registered UPACs for the years 2023 and 2024. The analysis integrates descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and inferential techniques to investigate three central research questions: the variation of average installed capacity per UPAC across districts; temporal changes in residential and industrial installations; and seasonal and scale-related patterns in total installed capacity. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of both spatial and temporal dynamics in the deployment of self-consumption systems across Portugal.

To ensure statistical robustness, the study employs a suite of inferential methods, including t-test, ANOVA, Levene’s test for variance homogeneity, and post-hoc pairwise comparisons, providing evidence for the significance of observed differences across sectors, regions, and years. By integrating technical, temporal, and regional dimensions, the research offers a rigorous characterization of Portugal’s self-consumption landscape, revealing the dual structure of the sector.
