    "# Phase 3: Data Preparation and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.1 Overview and Initial Import**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this research was imported from the e-Redes, it contains detailed records of **Production Units for Self-Consumption (UPAC)** across Portugal, with information on **geographic location, technology type, voltage level, installed capacity, number of installations**, and **temporal identification by quarter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the data, the dataset consisted of **121,294 observations and 16 variables**. Each record represents a unique aggregation of installations for a specific parish, quarter, and voltage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance clarity, two variables originally in Portuguese —\n",
    "`relacao_instalacoes_por_cpe` and `relacao_potencia_por_cpe` — were renamed to\n",
    "`installations_per_cpe_ratio` and `power_per_cpe_ratio`, respectively. This step ensured full linguistic consistency in English for subsequent analysis and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.2 Structure and Content Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial inspection revealed that the dataset included **eight categorical (object) variables** and **eight numerical variables (integer or float)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical attributes were inspected to assess the **diversity of categories and potential coding issues**. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Quarter` contained **11 unique values**, ranging from **2022T4 to 2025T2**, indicating quarterly data coverage and allowing temporal segmentation.\n",
    "* `District` included **18 Portuguese administrative districts**, ensuring national representativeness.\n",
    "* `Municipality` and `Parish` contained **278 and 2872 unique identifiers**, respectively, reflecting the high granularity of spatial data.\n",
    "* `Technology Type` initially included **Portuguese labels** (e.g., *“Fotovoltaica”*, *“Eólica”*), requiring translation.\n",
    "* `Voltage level` contained **five categories (AT, MT, BTE, BTN, NaN)**, corresponding to the different grid connection levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exploratory steps confirmed the **internal consistency** of the dataset, but also identified the need for **translation, filtering, and standardization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.3 Variable Translation and Harmonization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset contained Portuguese terminology, a translation dictionary was applied to ensure interpretability in English-language analysis and reporting. The `Technology Type` variable was harmonized using the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original (PT)           | Translated (EN)            |\n",
    "| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |\n",
    "| Solar                   | Solar                      |\n",
    "| Fotovoltaica            | Photovoltaic               |\n",
    "| Eólica                  | Wind                       |\n",
    "| Hídrica                 | Hydro                      |\n",
    "| Biogás                  | Biogas                     |\n",
    "| Biomassa                | Biomass                    |\n",
    "| Cogeração não renovável | Non-renewable Cogeneration |\n",
    "| Não Atribuído           | Not Assigned               |\n",
    "\n",
    "After translation, the dataset presented **eight consistent technology categories**, supporting cross-comparative analyses of energy sources and allowing aggregation into renewable vs. non-renewable groups when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.4 Data Selection and Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the research scope, the analysis focused exclusively on **the most recent and complete years (2023 and 2024)**.\n",
    "Records from 2022 and 2025 were excluded to maintain temporal comparability and avoid partial-year biases, since those periods do not contain all four quarters of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering, the dataset retained **88,511 valid observations**, distributed across eight quarters (`2023T1–2024T4`).\n",
    "This filtering step also ensured that all analyses reflect **recent, stable regulatory conditions** under the Portuguese self-consumption framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a subset of columns was retained to streamline analysis, focusing on those directly relevant to the research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temporal: `Quarter`\n",
    "* Spatial: `District`, `Municipality`, `Parish`\n",
    "* Technical: `Technology Type`, `Voltage level`, `Installed power range (kW)`\n",
    "* Quantitative: `Number of installations`, `Total installed power (kW)`, `CPEs (#)`\n",
    "* Derived ratios: `installations_per_cpe_ratio`, `power_per_cpe_ratio`\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced the dataset to **12 key analytical variables**, minimizing redundancy while preserving interpretive richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.5 Missing Values and Duplicate Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic inspection of missing data revealed **only two incomplete records**, corresponding to null values in non-critical fields. These were removed given their negligible proportion (<0.01%), ensuring a clean analytical base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, duplicate records were detected and subsequently dropped. The number of duplicates was minimal, confirming the **internal integrity of e-Redes data**.\n",
    "After these cleaning steps, the dataset remained with **88,511 unique, non-null entries**, providing robust coverage for statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.6 Derived and Enriched Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance analytical depth, several **derived variables** were constructed from the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(a) Voltage Level Proportions per District**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the classification provided by the *Manual de Ligações à Rede* (e-Redes), voltage levels were grouped into functional categories reflecting user type:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Voltage                         | Typical Use        | Interpretation                         |\n",
    "| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **AT (Alta Tensão)**            | >10 MVA, 60 kV     | Large industries / heavy manufacturing |\n",
    "| **MT (Média Tensão)**           | 10–30 kV, >200 kVA | Industrial and commercial sectors      |\n",
    "| **BTE (Baixa Tensão Especial)** | >41.4 kVA          | Small to medium businesses             |\n",
    "| **BTN (Baixa Tensão Normal)**   | <41.4 kVA          | Residential and small commercial users |\n",
    "\n",
    "To characterize the industrial vs. residential profile of each district, the percentage of installations by voltage level was computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{District Voltage Share (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Installations by Voltage Level}}{\\text{Total Installations in District}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide valuable proxies for **district-level industrialization**, with higher AT/MT shares indicating greater industrial or commercial energy use intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(b) Seasonal Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "A derived variable, `Season`, was added by mapping each quarter to a seasonal category:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Winter:** Q1 (T1) and Q4 (T4)\n",
    "* **Summer:** Q2 (T2) and Q3 (T3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation enables **seasonal comparative analysis**, crucial for understanding the temporal dynamics of energy production, particularly in solar-dominated systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.7 Data Type Verification and Final Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following cleaning and transformation, the dataset included the following key data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Type            | Example Variables                                            |\n",
    "| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **Categorical (object)** | `District`, `Quarter`, `Voltage level`, `Season`             |\n",
    "| **Continuous (float)**   | `Total installed power (kW)`, `power_per_cpe_ratio`          |\n",
    "| **Count (int)**          | `Number of installations`, `CPEs (#)`                        |\n",
    "| **Derived ratios (%)**   | `District_High_Voltage_AT(%)`, `District_Low_Voltage_BTN(%)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset’s structure now allows for both **descriptive** and **inferential statistical analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.8 Descriptive Summary and Initial Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical summary of numerical variables reveals highly **skewed distributions**, typical of energy datasets dominated by small residential systems and a few large industrial installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key descriptive insights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable                      | Mean   | Std    | Min   | Max    | Interpretation                                                       |\n",
    "| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `Number of installations`     | 17.48  | 58.12  | 1     | 2118   | Most parishes have few UPACs; some outliers with dense concentration |\n",
    "| `Total installed power (kW)`  | 122.14 | 383.76 | 0     | 19,600 | Wide range reflecting residential vs. industrial scales              |\n",
    "| `installations_per_cpe_ratio` | 0.0008 | 0.0023 | –     | 0.052  | Indicates that even in active areas, penetration remains low         |\n",
    "| `power_per_cpe_ratio`         | 0.0059 | 0.0311 | –     | 3.20   | Few parishes have high self-consumption penetration                  |\n",
    "| `District_Low_Voltage_BTN(%)` | 95.68% | 1.29   | 89.99 | 98.29  | Confirms overwhelming residential dominance in UPAC deployment       |\n",
    "| `District_High_Voltage_AT(%)` | 0.017% | 0.017  | 0.00  | 0.075  | Industrial-scale installations remain rare                           |\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics illustrate the **residential bias** of self-consumption in Portugal, with most installations connected at the **low-voltage level (BTN)**, while **industrial high-voltage (AT/MT)** systems represent only a marginal proportion.\n",
    "Nonetheless, their contribution in installed power (kW) is disproportionately large — a pattern that motivates the inferential analyses presented in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.9 Conclusion of Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation phase represented a fundamental step in establishing a reliable and analytically coherent dataset for this research. Starting from the original raw data provided by e-Redes, several transformation and cleaning procedures were applied to ensure accuracy, consistency, and interpretability of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, all variables were examined to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates. The inspection confirmed a high degree of integrity within the e-Redes data, with only two incomplete entries and a small number of duplicates, which were removed to guarantee analytical precision. After this process, the dataset contained exclusively valid, unique, and non-null records, providing a robust empirical base for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent steps focused on **linguistic harmonization and variable standardization**. Portuguese-language variables were systematically translated into English to maintain terminological coherence throughout the study. This included the harmonization of the “Technology Type” field and the renaming of technical indicators such as *relacao_instalacoes_por_cpe* and *relacao_potencia_por_cpe*, now presented as *installations_per_cpe_ratio* and *power_per_cpe_ratio*. This ensured conceptual clarity and facilitated international readability of the research outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To align the dataset with the study’s research objectives, **temporal and spatial filtering** was applied. Only complete and comparable periods—namely the years **2023 and 2024**—were retained, excluding partial years (2022 and 2025) to prevent distortions in temporal analyses. This filtering preserved a comprehensive and representative sample of self-consumption installations under stable regulatory and operational conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond cleaning and translation, **data enrichment** was performed through the creation of derived variables. Voltage levels were reclassified according to their functional meaning (high, medium, and low voltage), allowing differentiation between industrial, commercial, and residential contexts. Additionally, a new variable identifying **seasonal periods (winter vs. summer)** was introduced, enabling subsequent comparisons of temporal patterns in self-consumption production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset, composed of **12 well-defined and relevant variables**, combined temporal, spatial, and technical information with derived indicators reflecting installation density, power intensity, and district-level characteristics. This structured and fully standardized dataset now provides the necessary conditions for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the data preparation stage successfully transformed a raw, multilingual dataset into a **clean, harmonized, and analytically enriched data foundation**. The process ensured accuracy, comparability, and interpretability, allowing the next phases of the study to focus on exploring patterns, testing relationships, and answering the research questions with statistical rigor.\n",

    "### **3.2.18 Conclusion of Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis conducted on the Portuguese self-consumption dataset revealed a series of consistent patterns that characterize the structure and dynamics of installations across voltage levels, districts, and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation analysis indicated that low-voltage residential installations (BTN) are strongly negatively correlated with both medium-voltage (MT) and low-voltage special (BTE) installations. This pattern suggests that districts dominated by residential connections tend to have proportionally fewer industrial or small commercial systems. In contrast, the number of installations and the total installed power display moderate positive correlations, indicating that districts with a higher number of installations also tend to exhibit greater installed capacity. Overall, voltage-level composition emerged as a central determinant distinguishing residential from industrial areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of installed power distribution showed a markedly skewed pattern, where a small number of very large industrial installations dominate the higher end of the power scale, while the vast majority of residential systems remain below 100 kW. Applying a logarithmic transformation made it possible to better visualize these disparities and compare distributions across districts and voltage levels. The results confirm that residential self-consumption systems dominate in number, whereas industrial and commercial installations contribute disproportionately to total installed power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal and voltage-level analyses further highlighted the structural differences among installation types. High-voltage (AT) systems correspond to a limited number of large industrial facilities with minimal seasonal variation. Medium-voltage (MT) installations, associated with industrial or large commercial users, also displayed stable power levels across seasons. Low-voltage systems (BTN and BTE) concentrated around smaller capacities, reflecting residential and small-business consumption patterns. These results reinforce that voltage level is the primary determinant of installed power, while seasonal fluctuations have only a marginal impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal trends between 2023 and 2024 reveal steady growth in both the number of installations and total installed power. Residential systems drive the numerical increase, while industrial units remain the main contributors to total capacity. This indicates gradual and consistent adoption rather than abrupt surges. A cumulative advantage effect is also evident, as districts with higher initial installation levels continue to expand more rapidly than less developed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial analysis at the district level confirmed the presence of clear regional differentiation. Districts such as Aveiro, Faro, and Setúbal are dominated by residential installations, whereas Évora, Vila Real, Beja, and Portalegre exhibit more industrial profiles. Spatial heterogeneity thus reinforces the necessity of district-level analyses to fully capture local patterns, since aggregated national figures mask these disparities. Seasonal effects, however, remain minimal at the district level, suggesting stable self-consumption patterns throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining district-level dynamics over time revealed steady increases in both the number of installations and total installed power. Major urban districts such as Porto, Braga, Lisboa, and Setúbal consistently lead in installation counts, reflecting higher population density and infrastructure availability. Despite the rising number of installations, the average power per installation remains relatively stable. When analyzed by voltage level, clear clustering patterns emerge: AT installations are few but large, MT installations represent medium-sized industrial capacity, BTN reflects strong residential growth, and BTE captures small commercial activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of voltage levels across installed power ranges confirms that residential scales (up to 4 kW) are dominated by BTN, small commercial ranges (4–30 kW) mostly combine BTN and BTE, and industrial scales above 30 kW are primarily represented by MT and AT. Voltage level thus effectively stratifies installations according to their operational scale and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A composite Industrialization Index, based on weighted shares of AT, MT, and BTE, enabled the classification of districts by their industrial character. Beja, Portalegre, Évora, and Aveiro emerged as the most industrialized, while Setúbal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real, Faro, and Coimbra were identified as predominantly residential. This pattern aligns with the analysis of UPAC types: industrial areas exhibit fewer but significantly larger installations, whereas residential areas are characterized by numerous small-scale systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of technology, the dataset shows clear dominance of Solar and “Not Assigned” categories in the number of installations, mostly at BTN voltage level, which reinforces the residential nature of self-consumption in Portugal. Wind and Biogas technologies are primarily associated with MT installations, while Photovoltaic and Biomass systems appear mainly in AT-level industrial setups. Temporal evolution reveals the rapid expansion of Solar technology, particularly in 2024, confirming its role as the main driver of self-consumption growth, while other renewable sources remain either stable or emerging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the exploratory analysis demonstrates that voltage level and UPAC type are the two fundamental dimensions explaining both the number of installations and the total installed capacity. Residential systems (BTN and BTE) dominate numerically, whereas industrial systems (MT and AT) dominate in terms of power contribution. Strong spatial heterogeneity and clear voltage-level stratification highlight the importance of regional and sectoral contexts. Temporal evolution indicates steady market expansion without extreme fluctuations, and technological analysis confirms Solar energy as the key enabler of Portugal’s growing self-consumption landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results point to a dual structure of self-consumption in Portugal—characterized by widespread, small-scale residential installations on one hand, and concentrated industrial capacity on the other—providing a solid empirical basis for further modeling, forecasting, and policy-oriented analyses.\n",
