    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-consumption energy systems (Total Production Units for Self-Consumption – UPACs) have become an essential part of Portugal’s ongoing energy transition, mirroring the European commitment to decentralized and renewable generation. Encouraged by supportive regulation and declining photovoltaic costs, these systems allow consumers to produce, store, and use electricity locally. In doing so, they reduce dependence on the national grid and contribute to the achievement of national decarbonization objectives. Their rapid expansion in recent years demonstrates their strategic role across both residential and industrial sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this growth has not been uniform across the country. The installed capacity of UPACs varies considerably between districts, voltage levels, and installation sizes. Residential units, generally linked to low-voltage networks, are widespread but small in capacity, while industrial systems, connected at medium or high voltage, are fewer in number but represent a substantial share of total installed power. These differences reflect variations in regional economic activity, the availability of space, and the rate of technology adoption, highlighting the need for region-specific, data-driven analyses to inform energy policy and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present study is based on a comprehensive dataset provided by e-Redes, which includes all registered UPACs for the years 2023 and 2024. The analysis integrates descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and inferential techniques to investigate three central research questions: the variation of average installed capacity per UPAC across districts; temporal changes in residential and industrial installations; and seasonal and scale-related patterns in total installed capacity. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of both spatial and temporal dynamics in the deployment of self-consumption systems across Portugal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure statistical robustness, the study employs a suite of inferential methods, including t-test, ANOVA, Levene’s test for variance homogeneity, and post-hoc pairwise comparisons, providing evidence for the significance of observed differences across sectors, regions, and years. By integrating technical, temporal, and regional dimensions, the research offers a rigorous characterization of Portugal’s self-consumption landscape, revealing the dual structure of the sector."

    "# Methodology of Statistical Research\n",
    "\n",
    "The present study follows the **six-step statistical investigation method**, commonly applied in quantitative research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(2) Ask a research question**\n",
    "2. **(1) Design a study and collect data**\n",
    "3. **Explore the data**\n",
    "4. **Draw inference**\n",
    "5. **Formulate conclusions**\n",
    "6. **Look back and ahead**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this framework traditionally begins with the formulation of a **research question**, we **reversed the first two steps**.\n",
    "Because this project originated from a **data-driven perspective**, the **e-Redes dataset** was first explored to understand its variables, structure, and analytical potential.\n",
    "Only then were the **research questions (RQs)** refined to ensure they were **relevant, measurable, and supported by the available data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the questions, the methodology proceeds through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data exploration and cleaning**, to ensure consistency and accuracy;\n",
    "* **Descriptive analysis**, to summarize and visualize the main patterns;\n",
    "* **Inferential testing** (e.g., ANOVA, Levene’s test), to assess statistical differences across groups;\n",
    "* **Interpretation and synthesis**, to draw evidence-based conclusions;\n",
    "* And finally, **reflection**, evaluating methodological limitations and identifying opportunities for future research.\n",

    "The central aim of this study is to understand how **seasons, regional, and power level** influence **self-consumption energy production patterns** in Portugal between **2023 and 2024**.\n",
    "The research adopts a structured hierarchy of one **general** and three **specific research questions (RQs)**, each addressing a distinct analytical dimension of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ:** How do seasonal (winter vs. summer), regional, and power level shape self-consumption energy production patterns in Portugal between 2023 and 2024?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Specific Research Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1:** Compare the difference of the total installed capacity between 2023 and 2024 on the selected districts.\n",
    "This question focuses on the **distribution of installed capacities**, evaluating how the average UPAC size varies geographically and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2:** Compare the evolution of installed capacity between 2023 and 2024 across residential and industrial UPACs to assess differences in growth patterns.\n",
    "This question explores the **growth trajectory** of self-consumption by UPAC type, investigating whether **residential or industrial systems** expanded more rapidly and whether this evolution differs across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ3:** Compare the total installed capacity for self-consumption across different power scales (installed capacity ranges) and seasons (winter vs. summer) in selected Portuguese districts during 2023 and 2024.\n",
    "This question integrates **seasonality and technical scale**, examining how environmental and system-level characteristics interact to shape production capacity across Portugal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these research questions provide a **comprehensive framework** for analyzing Portugal’s recent self-consumption landscape — bridging **temporal evolution**, **regional heterogeneity**, and **technical diversity** within the renewable energy transition.\n",

    "# Phase 3: Data Preparation and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Overview and Initial Import\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this research was imported from the e-Redes, it contains detailed records of **Production Units for Self-Consumption (UPAC)** across Portugal, with information on geographic location, technology type, voltage level, installed capacity, number of installations, and temporal identification by quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the data, the dataset consisted of 121,294 observations and 16 variables. Each record represents a unique aggregation of installations for a specific parish, quarter, and voltage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance clarity, two variables originally in Portuguese, `relacao_instalacoes_por_cpe` and `relacao_potencia_por_cpe`, were renamed to `installations_per_cpe_ratio` and `power_per_cpe_ratio`, respectively. This step ensured full linguistic consistency in English for subsequent analysis and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.2 Structure and Content Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial inspection revealed that the dataset included eight categorical variables and eight numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical attributes were inspected to assess the diversity of categories and potential coding issues. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Quarter` contained **11 unique values**, ranging from **2022T4 to 2025T2**, indicating quarterly data coverage and allowing temporal segmentation.\n",
    "* `District` included **18 Portuguese administrative districts**, ensuring national representativeness.\n",
    "* `Municipality` and `Parish` contained **278 and 2872 unique identifiers**, respectively, reflecting the high granularity of spatial data.\n",
    "* `Technology Type` initially included **Portuguese labels** (e.g., *“Fotovoltaica”*, *“Eólica”*), requiring translation.\n",
    "* `Voltage level` contained **five categories (AT, MT, BTE, BTN, NaN)**, corresponding to the different grid connection levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exploratory steps confirmed the internal consistency of the dataset, but also identified the need for translation, filtering, and standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.3 Variable Translation and Harmonization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset contained Portuguese terminology, a translation dictionary was applied to ensure interpretability in English-language analysis and reporting. The `Technology Type` variable was harmonized using the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original (PT)           | Translated (EN)            |\n",
    "| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |\n",
    "| Solar                   | Solar                      |\n",
    "| Fotovoltaica            | Photovoltaic               |\n",
    "| Eólica                  | Wind                       |\n",
    "| Hídrica                 | Hydro                      |\n",
    "| Biogás                  | Biogas                     |\n",

    "| Não Atribuído           | Not Assigned               |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.4 Data Selection and Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the research scope, the analysis focused exclusively on **the most recent and complete years (2023 and 2024)**.\n",
    "Records from 2022 and 2025 were excluded to maintain temporal comparability and avoid partial-year biases, since those periods do not contain all four quarters of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering, the dataset retained 88,511 valid observations, distributed across eight quarters (`2023T1–2024T4`).\n",
    "This filtering step also ensured that all analyses reflect recent and stable regulatory conditions under the Portuguese self-consumption framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a subset of columns was retained to streamline analysis, focusing on those directly relevant to the research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temporal: `Quarter`\n",
    "* Spatial: `District`, `Municipality`, `Parish`\n",
    "* Technical: `Technology Type`, `Voltage level`, `Installed power range (kW)`\n",
    "* Quantitative: `Number of installations`, `Total installed power (kW)`, `CPEs (#)`\n",
    "* Derived ratios: `installations_per_cpe_ratio`, `power_per_cpe_ratio`\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced the dataset to **12 key analytical variables** while still preserving interpretive richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.5 Missing Values and Duplicate Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic inspection of missing data revealed **only two incomplete records**, corresponding to null values in non-critical fields. These were removed given their negligible proportion (<0.01%), ensuring a clean analytical base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, duplicate records were detected and subsequently dropped. The number of duplicates was minimal, confirming the **internal integrity of e-Redes data**.\n",
    "After these cleaning steps, the dataset remained with **88,511 unique, non-null entries**, providing robust coverage for statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.6 Derived and Enriched Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance analytical depth, several **derived variables** were constructed from the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(a) Voltage Level Proportions per District**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the classification provided by the *Manual de Ligações à Rede* (e-Redes), voltage levels were grouped into functional categories reflecting user type:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Voltage                         | Typical Use        | Interpretation                         |\n",
    "| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **AT (Alta Tensão)**            | >10 MVA, 60 kV     | Large industries / heavy manufacturing |\n",
    "| **MT (Média Tensão)**           | 10–30 kV, >200 kVA | Industrial and commercial sectors      |\n",
    "| **BTE (Baixa Tensão Especial)** | >41.4 kVA          | Small to medium businesses             |\n",
    "| **BTN (Baixa Tensão Normal)**   | <41.4 kVA          | Residential and small commercial users |\n",
    "\n",
    "To characterize the industrial vs. residential profile of each district, the percentage of installations by voltage level was computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{District Voltage Share (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Installations by Voltage Level}}{\\text{Total Installations in District}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide valuable proxies for **district-level industrialization**, with higher AT/MT shares indicating greater industrial or commercial energy use intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(b) Seasonal Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "A derived variable, `Season`, was added by mapping each quarter to a seasonal category:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Winter:** Q1 (T1) and Q4 (T4)\n",
    "* **Summer:** Q2 (T2) and Q3 (T3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation allows for seasonal comparisons, helping to capture the temporal dynamics of energy production, especially in solar-dominated systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.7 Data Type Verification and Final Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following cleaning and transformation, the dataset included the following key data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Type            | Example Variables                                            |\n",
    "| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **Categorical (object)** | `District`, `Quarter`, `Voltage level`, `Season`             |\n",
    "| **Continuous (float)**   | `Total installed power (kW)`, `power_per_cpe_ratio`          |\n",
    "| **Count (int)**          | `Number of installations`, `CPEs (#)`                        |\n",
    "| **Derived ratios (%)**   | `District_High_Voltage_AT(%)`, `District_Low_Voltage_BTN(%)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset’s structure now allows for both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.8 Descriptive Summary and Initial Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical summary of numerical variables reveals highly **skewed distributions**, typical of energy datasets dominated by small residential systems and a few large industrial installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable                      | Mean   | Std    | Min   | Max    | Interpretation                                                       |\n",

    "### **3.1.9 Conclusion of Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation phase established a clean and analytically coherent foundation for this research. The original dataset from e-Redes, containing over 121,000 observations, was systematically examined for inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates. Only two incomplete entries and a minimal number of duplicates were removed, resulting in 88,511 unique and valid records suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key transformations included the translation and harmonization of Portuguese-language variables into English, including the “Technology Type” field and the renaming of *relacao_instalacoes_por_cpe* and *relacao_potencia_por_cpe* to `installations_per_cpe_ratio` and `power_per_cpe_ratio`. These steps ensured terminological consistency and improved interpretability for subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To align the dataset with the research objectives, temporal and spatial filtering retained only complete periods (2023–2024) and relevant districts, providing a representative and comparable sample of self-consumption installations. Furthermore, derived variables were created to enrich the dataset: voltage levels were categorized by functional meaning to distinguish residential, commercial, and industrial installations, and a seasonal variable (Winter vs. Summer) was added to support temporal comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset consists of 12 key variables encompassing temporal, spatial, technical, and derived indicators, offering a structured and comprehensive framework for descriptive and inferential analysis. Overall, the data preparation stage successfully converted a raw, multilingual dataset into a clean, standardized, and enriched analytical resource, ensuring accuracy, comparability, and interpretability for the subsequent phases of the study.\n",

    "### **3.2.18 Conclusion of Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory analysis of Portuguese self-consumption (UPAC) data highlighted consistent patterns across voltage levels, districts, and time. Correlation analysis revealed a strong negative relationship between low-voltage residential installations (BTN) and both medium-voltage (MT) and low-voltage special (BTE) installations, suggesting that residential-dominated districts host proportionally fewer industrial or small commercial systems. Moderate positive correlations between the number of installations and total installed power indicate that districts with more installations generally have higher capacity, emphasizing voltage-level composition as a key differentiator between residential and industrial areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power distribution is highly skewed: a few large industrial installations dominate high-power ranges, while most residential systems remain below 100 kW. Logarithmic transformations facilitated visualization of these disparities, confirming that residential installations dominate numerically, whereas industrial and commercial systems contribute disproportionately to total installed capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis by voltage level and season reinforced these patterns. High-voltage (AT) installations are few but extremely large, medium-voltage (MT) systems reflect industrial and commercial users, and low-voltage (BTN/BTE) installations are concentrated at smaller capacities. Seasonal variations are minimal, indicating stable residential self-consumption throughout the year, with voltage level being the primary determinant of installed power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal trends from 2023 to 2024 reveal steady growth. Residential systems drive increases in installation counts, while industrial units remain the largest contributors to total power. District-level dynamics show that urban areas like Porto, Braga, Lisboa, and Setúbal consistently lead in numbers, with average power per installation remaining stable despite rising counts. The cumulative advantage effect is evident, as districts with higher initial installation levels continue to expand faster than less developed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial analysis confirmed regional heterogeneity. Vila Real, Faro, and Setúbal are residential-dominated, while Évora, Aveiro, Beja, and Portalegre exhibit industrial profiles. Voltage levels stratify installations by scale: residential ranges (≤4 kW) are mainly BTN, small commercial ranges (4–30 kW) are BTN/BTE, and industrial scales (>30 kW) are dominated by MT and AT. A composite Industrialization Index validated this division, showing that industrial districts host fewer but larger installations, whereas residential areas have many small systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology-wise, Solar and “Not Assigned” categories dominate in number, primarily at BTN, reinforcing the residential character of self-consumption. MT-level installations are associated with Wind and Biogas, while AT-level industrial setups include Photovoltaic and Biomass. Solar adoption has grown rapidly, particularly in 2024, serving as the main driver of self-consumption expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, voltage level and UPAC type emerge as the primary determinants of both installation count and total capacity. The dual structure of self-consumption in Portugal—numerous small residential installations versus concentrated industrial capacity—is reinforced by clear spatial, temporal, and technological patterns. These insights provide a robust foundation for further modeling, forecasting, and policy-oriented analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings reveal a dual pattern in Portugal’s self-consumption landscape, with numerous small-scale residential installations alongside concentrated industrial capacity, offering a strong empirical foundation for modeling, forecasting, and policy analysis.\n",

    "1. **Sector Effect:** Residential and Industrial UPACs show highly significant differences in installed capacity across all districts (robust ANOVA, mean F ≈ 428.5, p < 0.05). Industrial installations consistently have higher mean power.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **District Effect:** Installed capacity varies significantly between districts (mean F ≈ 86.5, p < 0.05), confirming regional patterns in self-consumption adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Year Effect:** There is a significant growth in installed capacity from 2023 to 2024 (mean F ≈ 61.5, p < 0.05), indicating increasing adoption across both sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Type × District** is significant (mean F ≈ 5.93, p < 0.05), meaning sector differences vary across districts.\n",
    "   * **Type × Year** is significant (mean F ≈ 15.33, p < 0.05), showing that growth patterns differ slightly between sectors.\n",
    "   * **District × Year** (mean F ≈ 0.674, p ≈ 0.617) and **Type × District × Year** (mean F ≈ 0.806, p ≈ 0.543) are not significant, suggesting that yearly growth is generally consistent across districts and combinations of sector and district.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Robustness:** Multiple random stratified samplings confirm the stability of these findings, even under heteroscedasticity observed in Levene’s tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Residential and Industrial UPACs differ significantly in installed capacity, district-level variations exist, and overall capacity increased from 2023 to 2024. While some sector-specific growth patterns vary by district, the main trends are consistent, and the results are robust across different random samples.\n",

    "#### **Statistical Test and Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "To test these hypotheses, a four-way ANOVA was applied with factors Power Scale (Installed Power Range), Season (Winter vs. Summer), District, and Year. This factorial model evaluates both the main effects and interactions between structural (scale), temporal (year), seasonal, and regional factors. Before conducting the analysis, the following assumptions were verified:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Samples Drawn from the Population**\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of four districts — Aveiro, Évora, Faro, and Vila Real — was selected to represent diverse geographic and climatic regions of Portugal, ensuring coverage of both coastal and inland areas. Data were included only when complete information was available for power scale, season, and total installed capacity for both years (2023–2024). This approach ensures representativeness of the population of UPAC self-consumption installations across regional and climatic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sufficiently Large Sample Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each combination of District, Power Scale, Season, and Year, stratified random samples were drawn, representing up to 10% of each subgroup. These sample sizes are large enough for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to apply, ensuring that the distribution of sample means approximates normality even if the population data are not perfectly normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independence of Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each UPAC installation represents an independent observation — a distinct self-consumption unit with its own installed capacity. Therefore, observations are independent both within and across groups (District × Power Scale × Season × Year).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normality of Residuals**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA assumes that residuals of installed capacity are approximately normally distributed within each group. The use of the log₁₀-transformed installed capacity (log₁₀_power) and stratified sampling support this assumption by reducing skewness and stabilizing variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneity of Variances**\n",
    "\n",
    "Levene’s test revealed significant differences in group variances (p < 0.001), indicating that the assumption of homoscedasticity required for standard ANOVA was not met. To address this, a four-way ANOVA with heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors (HC3) was applied. This robust approach adjusts for unequal variances across groups, providing reliable F- and p-values even under heteroscedastic conditions."

Therefore, a four-way ANOVA with heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors (HC3) was applied. The HC3 estimator adjusts the covariance matrix of the model to account for unequal variances among groups, providing robust F- and p-values even under heteroscedastic conditions. In practice, this approach is equivalent to a Welch-type correction extended to multifactor ANOVA designs, ensuring that the results remain reliable despite variance inequality."

For instance, Aveiro and Évora exhibited increased differentiation between scales in 2024, while Faro showed more uniformity across ranges. Vila Real also displayed a clearer separation between small and large installations in 2024. These variations point to region-dependent growth patterns in the self-consumption sector."

    "1. **Seasonal Effect:** No significant effect (mean p ≈ 0.44). Installed capacity remains stable between winter and summer, showing minimal seasonal influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **District Effect:** Strongly significant (mean p ≈ 2.0e-56). Capacity differs across districts, confirming clear regional disparities in UPAC adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Year Effect:** Highly significant (mean p ≈ 1.4e-16). Installed capacity increased by about 20% from 2023 to 2024, confirming sustained growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Power Scale Effect:** Strongly significant (p ≈ 0.00). Larger UPACs show higher installed power, confirming a consistent scaling pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interactions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Year × Power Scale: Significant (p ≈ 5.5e-13). Capacity growth in 2024 concentrated in larger installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * District × Power Scale: Significant (p ≈ 1.1e-29). Scale effects vary by district, showing regional scaling differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Year × District × Power Scale: Weakly significant (p ≈ 0.024). Growth by scale differs slightly between districts: stronger in Aveiro and Évora, more uniform in Faro, clearer separation in Vila Real.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Interactions involving Season: Not significant (p > 0.05). Seasonal patterns remain consistent across years, districts, and scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Four-way Interaction: Not significant (p ≈ 0.35). No combined seasonal influence detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Robustness:** Results are stable across 20 random stratified samples. Significant effects (Year, District, Scale) persist, while seasonal and higher-order terms remain non-significant. The HC3 correction ensured reliability under heteroscedasticity (Levene’s p < 0.001).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Season has no measurable impact on installed UPAC capacity. Growth is driven by Year, District, and Scale, not by seasonal variation. Patterns are consistent and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with RQ1 and RQ2, these results confirm that total installed power increased from 2023 to 2024, mainly due to scale and regional factors, not seasonal effects."

    "# Phase 5: Formulate Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of self-consumption Production Units (UPACs) in Portugal for 2023–2024 provides an integrated view of how regional, sectoral, and power levels shape the national self-consumption landscape. Building on the outcomes of the data preparation and exploratory analyses (Phases 3.1–3.2), the dataset’s high granularity and verified integrity enabled consistent modeling across spatial, temporal, and voltage-level dimensions. The results across the three research questions converge on several coherent conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **RQ1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between 2023 and 2024 reveals a clear upward trend in total installed capacity for self-consumption across the selected districts. The results consistently indicate that installations expanded in scale and number, reflecting accelerated adoption and investment in decentralized generation. This growth highlights the maturation of the UPAC sector and points to increasing regional engagement in self-consumption initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed increase is stable across repeated analyses and not driven by sampling variation, confirming that the year-on-year growth represents a genuine structural change rather than a statistical anomaly. These outcomes suggest that 2024 marked a consolidation phase for UPAC development, laying the groundwork for continued expansion in subsequent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, RQ1 demonstrates that self-consumption capacity grew significantly between 2023 and 2024, confirming the strong temporal dynamic underlying Portugal’s distributed energy transition. This finding provides a baseline for examining how regional and sectoral factors shaped the pattern and intensity of this growth in the following research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **RQ2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional and power-level factors are the primary drivers of self-consumption patterns in Portugal, while seasonal effects are minimal. Industrial UPACs dominate installed capacity, but their distribution varies markedly across districts, with Évora, Aveiro, and Faro exhibiting distinct adoption patterns. Residential systems, though more numerous, contribute smaller capacities and also show clear regional disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth from 2023 to 2024 is consistent across sectors and districts, reflecting nationwide expansion. The robustness of these patterns, confirmed through multiple random stratified samplings, indicates that sectoral and regional differences are stable and not due to sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, RQ2 demonstrates that self-consumption patterns are strongly shaped by the interaction of sector type and regional context: industrial capacity is concentrated in specific districts, residential capacity is more widely distributed, and seasonal variation has negligible impact. These results directly illustrate how power level and geography jointly structure Portugal’s self-consumption landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **RQ3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals that seasonal variation has no significant influence on installed capacity, confirming that self-consumption operates as a stable component of decentralized generation throughout the year. In contrast, strong effects were identified for Year, District, and Installed Power Range, demonstrating that temporal growth, regional disparities, and system scale remain the dominant forces shaping the UPAC landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant interactions between Year × Power Scale and District × Power Scale indicate that capacity growth from 2023 to 2024 was driven primarily by larger installations and that the distribution of these scales varies across regions. The weaker three-way interaction (Year × District × Power Scale) further suggests that this scaling dynamic evolved differently among districts, reflecting diverse regional investment trajectories and resource conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, RQ3 shows that Portugal’s self-consumption sector expanded unevenly across regions and installation sizes but remained unaffected by seasonal factors. Growth is primarily structural, linked to geographic and scale dimensions, rather than cyclical. These findings reinforce the temporal and regional patterns identified in RQ1 and RQ2, confirming that the expansion of self-consumption between 2023 and 2024 is both robust and systematically driven by district-level and scale-dependent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overall Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating results from data preparation, exploration, and inferential analysis, the Portuguese self-consumption sector exhibits a bifurcated structure: a broad residential base of small BTN systems and a narrow but powerful industrial segment connected via MT and AT levels. Voltage level consistently emerges as a decisive factor shaping both installation count and capacity magnitude. Regional disparities remain evident, mirroring socio-economic and infrastructural contrasts. The minimal seasonal influence confirms that self-consumption, predominantly solar,is a stable, continuous contributor to decentralized generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the 2023–2024 period represents a consolidation phase for self-consumption in Portugal. Household adoption continues to expand, industrial investment is accelerating, and spatial diversity persists as a defining characteristic. By tracing these outcomes back to the structured data preparation and exploratory phases, the analysis provides a comprehensive and empirically grounded picture of Portugal’s evolving, decentralized energy landscape.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Look Back — Reflections and Project Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, several practical and analytical challenges contributed to shaping a stronger methodological approach. During data preparation, the main focus was on ensuring data consistency and clarity. This included translating column names from Portuguese to English for uniform documentation, checking for missing values, and removing duplicate records to guarantee data integrity. Managing a large dataset of over 120,000 observations also required careful filtering to focus on the 2023–2024 period and retain only the most relevant variables. Another key challenge was addressing the strong skewness of installed power distributions, which led to the application of log-transformations and robust statistical methods such as Welch’s t-tests and HC3-corrected ANOVA. Integrating multiple analytical dimensions (temporal, spatial, and scale-related) demanded consistent validation to ensure coherent results. Overall, these challenges strengthened the project’s analytical quality and provided valuable experience in handling large-scale, heterogeneous energy datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Look Ahead — Future Directions and Opportunities**\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this research provide a foundation for expanding the analysis of self-consumption in Portugal. Building on the 2023–2024 results, future work could develop in three complementary directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Extension and Forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the dataset beyond 2024 would enable modeling of medium-term growth trends and potential market saturation. Including future policy measures, such as storage incentives, could help assess regulatory effectiveness and forecast adoption trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial and Socio-economic Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining UPAC data with demographic, income, and land-use indicators could uncover the socio-economic drivers of renewable adoption. Such integration would support evidence-based incentives that address spatial disparities and encourage balanced regional expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical and Environmental Assessment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging capacity data with actual generation outputs and meteorological information would allow evaluation of system performance and carbon-offset potential, linking deployment data to tangible environmental benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a policy perspective, the findings highlight the importance of continued support for residential-scale adoption, alongside enhanced facilitation of industrial-scale integration. Reducing regional disparities, particularly in interior districts, would further promote territorial equity and accelerate Portugal’s shift toward a decentralized, renewable-based energy system.\n"
